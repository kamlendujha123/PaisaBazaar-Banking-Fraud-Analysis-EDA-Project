Our goal is to explore and analyze the dataset and find insights and trends to know the relationship between individuals and their previous transaction history by this we will investigate what factors influence the credit scores. In this analysis, we will look at attributes like SSN(Social Security number), annual income, monthly salary, outstanding balance, number of loans, and many more to learn the pattern. By identifying these key factors we will create a EDA model that will identify how various attributes influence the individual's credit score as (GOOD, Poor, Standard). This model will help paisaBazaar to enhance their decision-making for loan approvals and will reduce the risk of loan defaults and will also improve customer satisfaction.\n",
